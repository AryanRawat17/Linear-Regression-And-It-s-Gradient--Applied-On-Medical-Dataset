# Linear Regression And It's Gradient: Applied On Medical Dataset
 ‒ Developed a predictive model using linear regression to estimate medical charges based on patient features,  achieving [insert metric, e.g., 85% accuracy or a specific R-squared value].  ‒ Applied gradient descent optimization to minimize the cost function, enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.  ‒ Conducted feature correlation analysis to determine the impact of variables like smoking status and BMI on medical  costs.  ‒ Visualized data and model performance using scatter plots and correlation matrices, providing actionable insights for  model refinement.
